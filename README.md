# Bank-Note-Authentication-Data

# ABSTRACT:
The choice of Activation Functions (AF) has proven to be an important factor that affects the performance of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Use a 1-hidden layer neural network model that adapts to the most suitable activation function according to the data-set. The ANN model can learn for itself the best AF to use by exploiting a flexible functional form, k0 + k1 âˆ— x with parameters k0, k1 being learned from multiple runs.

# Attribute Information
1.variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
2.skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
3.curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
4.entropy of image (continuous)
5.class (integer)


# Data Set Information:
This is a classification project, since the variable to be predicted is binary (fraudulent or legal). The goal here is to model the probability that a banknote is fraudulent, as a function of its features.
